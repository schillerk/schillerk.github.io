    <div style="font-size: 17pt; display: inline;">China's Foreign Censorship as Economic Protectionism

  Though China's censorship has been widely viewed by Western audiences as an unambiguous denial of basic human rights, in the world of high-tech entrepreneurship, blocking foreign services is a way to ensure competitive advantage.
  <p></p>
  Under ordinary circumstances, protectionism refers to the practice of restricting trade between nations, often through tariffs imposed on imported goods in an attempt to promote a nation's domestic production. In the case of electronic media, foreign goods are instead banned altogether, or limited with intent to cripple. This not only allows for the domestic production of foreign goods, but also for domestic imitation.
  <p></p>
  Even before the rise of mass consumer technology, China had a reputation for producing and exporting physical goods at a reduced cost. While "originally used to describe a bandit stronghold outside government control", the term shanzhai "today refers to business based on fake or pirated products" [1] and is used to describe the broad base of practices centered around the cheap imitation of established good or services. Products such as the "hiPhone" and "Adidos" may draw laughter, but businesses run this way have been hugely successful and "evolve with astonishing speed to challenge incumbent players in mature industries" [2]. While a 2009 Booz&Co report argues that shanzhai businesses success only by sacrificing quality, the context of mass consumer software development has forced radical transformation.
  <p></p>
  First, software can be replicated and distributed for free, meaning that once an existing product exists, trying to undercut existing products is no longer an effective strategy. Second, and much more fundamentally, shanzhai relies on imitation to negate R&D costs, but in the case of software development, consumers will never require multiple copies of the same application. In order to survive, imitators must become innovators.
  <p></p>
  And yet, China's consumer internet sphere has continued to see the rise of products that explicitly imitate their predecessors, and still manage to succeed tremendously. Baidu, for example, is often referred to as "China's google", and thus seen as a mere imitation, yet manages to be the most visited site in China, and the 4th most visited site in the world (Alexa). Along similar lines, the hugely popular Weibo is considered to be the "Chinese Twitter" and Alibaba the "Chinese Amazon". Somehow, even while imitating existing products, each of these companies has managed to achieve extraordinary success.
  <p></p>
  The answer lies in China's widespread media censorship, which, in recent years, has extended to full bans on many popular american websites. In the words of venture capitalist Kaifu Lee, "government censorship… keeps international giants from entering the market", thus allowing for the cultivation of Chinese versions of the same businesses [3]. As these companies begin to move beyond their American counterparts, Chinese technological innovation and entrepreneurship has taken it's place both in the Chinese economy, as well as the world stage.
  <p></p>
  The end result is not only imitation itself, but mass imitation leading to an entirely new dynamic centered on aggressive growth. An essential part of shanzhais' historical success was their ability to "operate in breach of, or at least on the borderline of, China's IP laws" due to the government's failure to enforce patent legislation [1]. As a result, a successful business in the U.S. will inevitably be imitated by not a single Chinese firm, but by a flock of entrepreneurs eager to capitalize on what's already been proven to work. In one case, American company Groupon lead to the creation of 5,000 similar companies [4].
  <p></p>
  Competition of this nature necessitates growth as a means of victory, but also as a means of survival. Startups, and contemporary tech startups in particular, tend to be characterized by venture capital funding and delayed monetization, with the latter occurring more and more often solely through advertising or data collection rather than forcing the user to pay for the product itself. Fictionalized in David Fincher's "The Social Network", Mark Zuckerberg explains this phenomenon by stating that "Facebook is cool and if we start installing pop-ups for Mountain Dew it's not going to be cool" [5]. The actual logic is barely more complicated: any product without advertising will be preferred by users over a similar product with advertising, and in the highly competitive landscape of imitative startups, monetizing at the cost of product quality is the same as death. In the case of data collection, a product must acquire a huge user base before attaining any real value from the data it gathers from them. In either case, it's investment first, profits later. In the meantime, competition insists that businesses expend huge amounts of money simply to acquire to customers, in some cases reportedly running at -90% ROI [6].
  <p></p>
  The result, unsurprisingly, is that a huge number of these startups fail, but for those that survive, the competition ought to be seen as a barrier to entry that guarantees excellence and drives aggressive growth. By this first point, I mean that any Groupon imitator capable of beating out 4,999 competitors is by absolute necessity a business capable of doing much more than taking ideas. In the words of Tencent founder and president Ma Huateng,"In America, when you bring an idea to market you usually have several months before competition pops up, allowing you to capture significant market share… In China, you can have hundreds of competitors within the first hours of going live. Ideas are not important in China—execution is." In this environment, yeman shengzhang, or "barbaric growth" takes precedence, and has been descried by one firm's China Experience Design Lead as "common sense to modern-day Chinese businessmen" [6]. In this environment, innovation takes on an entirely new meaning, but victory is just as sweet.
