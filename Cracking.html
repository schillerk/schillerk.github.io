    In a now famous article, professor David Shambaug argued that the "political repression that has blanketed China" was a "symptom of the party leadership's deep anxiety" around the capacity of social control [1] While perhaps damning, his arguments rely on several fundamental misunderstandings about technological capacity and the sociological function of surveillance.
    <p></p>
    First, let's consider the degree to which surveillance, and censorship along with it, has penetrated the Chinese discourse. Research from the University of Toronto indicates that censorship on WeChat hovers around 1.5% for user accounts and 4% for individual posts [2]. While these numbers appear small, fixating on them ignores the simple truth: every single post is read before publication, and subject to automatic filters. Even this doesn't go far enough. The truth is that most posts are filtered long before they reach the internet by users who understand the potential repercussions of their speech, and have learned to limit themselves. Even moderate censorship of expression leads to pervasive censorship of thought.
    <p></p>
    From a theoretical standpoint, we may turn to Marx who claimed that "the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force" [3] or Zizek's more contemporary criticism that, "the ruling system has even oppressed our capacity to dream" [4]. In either case, the basic idea isn't nearly as complicated as their rhetoric: a person taught to believe that they will never be able to express a certain category of ideas will soon cease to consider them as well. This isn't to say that there exist no ideological dissidents, or that China's private offline conversations are totally lacking in resistance; however, language exists for the purpose of communication, and without that as a possibility, even the potential for transgressive thought begins to fade.
    <p></p>
    Censorship, of course, has the necessary prerequisite of surveillance. As described by Georgetown law professor Julie Cohen, "pervasive monitoring of every first move or false start will, at the margin, incline choices towards the bland the mainstream. The result will be a subtle yet fundamental shift in the concern of our character, a blunting and blurring of rough edges and sharp lines" [5]. Thus, surveillance begets conformity, not as a potential consequence, but as a necessary byproduct. Another legal scholar, Harvard's Laurence Lessig, insists that "observing will affect the observed" and goes on to describe the exact mechanism missing from Cohen's paper:
    <p></p>
    The system watches what you do; it fits you into a pattern; the patter is then fed  back to you in the form of options set by the patter; the options reinforce the     pattern; the cycle begins again [6].
    <p></p>
    In the case of advertising, this takes of form of enforcing perceived preferences by catering to them, thus narrowing the focus of predicted user behavior, and subsequently, the perceived preferences themselves. If surveillance can succeed in imposing conformity without the need for censors to read every word, arguments against scalability fall completely flat.
    <p></p>
    Given this framework, we can now turn to an analysis of Sesame Credit, a massive social credit program conceived in partnership with tech giant Alibaba. Using uses tracked behavior to evaluate, and ultimately rank citizens on the basis of their "trustworthiness" [7]. The original program proposal, translated into English, reads that one aim of the program is to "forcefully advocate sincerity and ethical norms, carry forward the positive and upward, sincere and trust-keeping traditional culture of the Chinese nation" [8]. This is fine, but of course, the problem is the determination of these ethical norms. This isn't at all unique to China, in order for a government to be effective, it must operate on the basis of some principles; however, the real issue with Sesame credit is the specific method of enforcement. Rather  than a binary distinction between law abiding citizen and criminal, the program evaluations along a spectrum, thus pushing citizens not only away from a border, but into a much more narrow cell determined by those patters of behavior deemed optional by the state government. The result is an authoritarian regime with unprecedented levels of control over its populace, paired with the ability to enforce that control both instantly and consistently.
    <p></p>
    While the Arab Spring, Occupy Protests, and other populist movements have crafted a particular view of technological influence as necessarily benefiting democracy, China's use of censorship and surveillance provides a compelling argument to the contrary. The real lesson here is not that we ought to be afraid, but that the particular effects of technology depend primarily on the way in which it gets implemented. In other words, design is at the very heart of impact, and in a world increasingly consumed by technology, the impact is huge.
