  Machine Learning. Bayesian Statistics. Big Data.

    It's all over the news, and according to social media giant Twitter,  "one glance at the numbers..." [1] is all it takes to determine the fate of an election cycle.
    <p></p>
    With Gallup backing out of election polling [2] and Nate Silver's 538 [3] on the rise, thereâ€™s every indication that we've entered into a radically new era. One where the celebrated voice of the people is quickly being replaced by a suite of elaborate tools, techniques, and Nvidia GPU backed algorithms designed to juice data for all its got.
    <p></p>
    In many ways, this is perfectly in line with the same trends we're seeing across the world. [4][5][6]
    <p></p>
    In a 2013 Speech at SXSW, Peter Thiel described the widespread state of "indefinite pessimism" where politics gets reduced to a a game of numbers and "the way we talk about political campaigns and elections is how are people doing in the polls much more than their ideas" [7]. Along similar lines, the rise of technology across every industry has carried a new reliance on data-driven justification, and with it, a distrust of human sentiment, intuition, and conviction.

    There is a growing backlash against this depersonalization of thought. A growing backpack agains the dramatic change in American decision making. There's no use in nostalgia, and the point here isn't to mourn the loss of some intangible dream. Rather, we stand in the midst of a world in flux, fully connected, and fully subject to the influence of those willing to grab hold.
    <p></p>
    We stand at a time when to talk of "The State of American Decision Making" is to grasp at straws and struggle to find order where there is only a flurry of voices. In other words, American Decision Making, is a process about to be determined, and we ought to be on the front lines making it happen.
