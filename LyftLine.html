    <p></p>
    Behind every design decision is an algorithm meant to implement it, and as easy as it is to forget, every algorithm is flawed.
    <p></p>
    What I mean by this is that algorithms aren't just tools for solving problems, they solve them in specific ways.
    <p></p>
    Lyft Line is a perfect example.
    <p></p>
    From a technical perspective, the problem seems relatively straightfoward: Given n users across a city each with their own pick up and drop off locations, and m drivers capable of picking up 2 users each, develop an algorithm that will get users to their destinations as quickly as possible. This certainly isn't an easy problem, but it is a simple one. There are unambiguous conditions, and an unambigious desired result.
    <p></p>
    Reality is never this simple.
    <p></p>
    In reality, it turns out users don't want to get to their destinations as quickly as possible. It turns out that users, people that is, are not machines. We are filled with quirks, flaws and prefernces grounded far outside rationality.
    <p></p>
    Specifically, we really hate going backwards.
    <p></p>
    In practice, this means that Lyft will never make a user go away from their destination, not even for one block. Not even when it's most efficient solution.
    <p></p>
    This means that if you're heading 10 blocks west, Lyft would rather connect you with a user 10 blocks north than a user 4 blocks east. Putting aside the complexities of traffic and city planning, a quick application of the Pythagorean Theorem tells us this just isn't quantitatively optimal.
    <p></p>
    Users might care about quantitative optimization, but people don't. As it turns out, actual people who use Lyft would rather take a long time going in the general direction of their destination than spend a short amount of time going in the opposite direction. Even if it means taking a longer time.
    <p></p>
    This means we have to focus on so much more than developing good solutions. We have to develop solutions that are good for people.
    <p></p>
    Cliched patitudes aside, there's a very serious tension here between our subjective judgements and the objective good. Just as there's a difference between pain and suffering, there's a difference between pleasure and happiness. As product designers, we absolutely have to focus on the latter.
    <p></p>
    Anything else is just masturbation.
